		<p>Using JavaScript, the user is prompted to choose a style for the page. Namely:</p>
		<ul id="list">
			<li>background for the page;</li>
			<li>font style on the page;</li>
			<li>alignment for header "h1";</li>
			<li>background for paragraph with links;</li>
			<li>color of the text in the paragraph with links and for the links, while the color of the text for the links is assigned in the loop;</li>
			<li>color, size, thickness of the text in the "div" element;</li>
			<li>marker type for a list on a page.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>In addition, instead of links to the specified specific sites, the navigation bar displays links to three sites  entered by the user.</p>
		<p>For example, the user entered the address football24.ua in the "prompt()" window. In this case, a link is created that leads to the football24 site, and the text of this link, which you can use to go to the specified site is also football24.ua.</p>
