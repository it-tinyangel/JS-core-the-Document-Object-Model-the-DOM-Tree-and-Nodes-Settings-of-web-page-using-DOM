## My Page Customizer

This is HTML web page that users can customize using JavaScript. It allows the user to change various styles and add their own links to the web page.

## User Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.

On this web page, the following parameters are provided for customization:

- Background of the web page
- Font type on the web page
- Alignment of the `h1` header
- Background of the paragraph `p` with links
- Text color in the `p` with links and for the links themselves
- Color, size, and font weight of text in the `div` element
- Bullet list marker type on the page

Additionally, users can input three custom links that will be displayed in the navigation panel.

This project allows the user to customize the web page to  your liking without the need to manually edit CSS[^1].

[^1]: This project demonstrates how the DOM helps access the tree model, and once access is granted, users can make any changes related to the composition, layout, content, or style of the HTML web page.

## Requirements

You'll need a web browser to view the HTML page.
