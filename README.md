## Settings of the web page "My page"

This is an HTML web page that the user can customize using JavaScript. It allows the user to change different styles and add their own links to the web page.

## User Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.

On this web page, the following parameters are provided for customization:

- Background of the web page
- The type of font on the web page
- Alignment for `h1` heading
- The background of the `nav` element with links
- The color of the text in the `nav` element with links and for the links themselves
- The color, size, and thickness of the text in the `main` element
- Bullet type for the list on the page

In addition, the user can enter three custom links that will be displayed in the navigation bar.

So, this web page allows the user to customize the web page to their liking without having to manually edit the CSS[^1].

[^1]: This web page demonstrates how the DOM helps to access the tree model and once access is granted, the user can make any changes related to the composition, layout, content or style of the HTML web page.
