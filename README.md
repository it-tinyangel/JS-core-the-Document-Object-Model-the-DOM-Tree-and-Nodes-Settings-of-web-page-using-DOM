## My Page Customizer

This project is an HTML web page that users can customize using JavaScript. It allows users to change various styles and add their own links to the web page.

## User Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your computer.
2. Open `index.html` in your favorite web browser.

On the web page, the following parameters are provided for customization:

- Background of the web page
- Font type on the web page
- Alignment of the `h1` header
- Background of the paragraph `p` with links
- Text color in the `p` with links and for the links themselves
- Color, size, and font weight of text in the `div` element
- Bullet list marker type on the page

Additionally, users can input three custom links that will be displayed in the navigation panel.

This project enables users to tailor the web page to their preferences without the need to manually modify CSS[^1].

[^1]: This project demonstrates how the DOM helps access the tree model, and once access is granted, users can make any changes related to the composition, layout, content, or style of the HTML web page.
